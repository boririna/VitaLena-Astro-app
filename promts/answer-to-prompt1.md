Understanding the Task and Provided Code
Task:

Modify the code to display 3 reviews per slide instead of one.
Use the provided Review component for each review.
Ensure the slider functionality remains intact.
Analysis of the Provided Code:

The code currently displays one review per slide.
The Review component is used to render individual reviews.
The slider functionality works by translating slides based on button clicks.

Proposed Solution

Breaking Down the Solution

Group reviews into threes: We'll need to group the array of reviews into chunks of three.

Iterate over the grouped reviews: For each group, create a slide and render three Review components.

Adjust the slider logic: Ensure that the slider's maxSlide value is calculated based on the number of groups, not individual reviews.

```js
JavaScript;
// ... (rest of your code)

const dataDesktop = json;

// Group reviews into arrays of 3
const reviewsGrouped = [];
for (let i = 0; i < dataDesktop.length; i += 3) {
  reviewsGrouped.push(dataDesktop.slice(i, i + 3));
}

// ... (rest of your code)

<div class="slider-desktop">
  {reviewsGrouped.map((group, index) => (
    <div class="slide" key={index}>
      {group.map((review) => (
        <Review
          key={review.name} // Assuming names are unique
          name={review.name}
          date={review.date}
          text={review.text}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>;
```
